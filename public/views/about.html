                    The number one ranked Keystone State Camps are directed by Pete White, one of the most knowledgeable and respected coaches in Pennsylvania. Coach White has 17 District Championships in a row, a Pennsylvania record.
                <br><br>
                    He also holds the record by winning 12 consecutive PIAA AAAA First Round Playoff Games. His 1984 undefeated 30-0 State Champions may be the best high school basketball team in Pennsylvania schoolboy history.
                <br><br>
                    In 1995 he was named the Pennsylvania Big School Coach of the Year by the Associated Press and led his team to a state runner-up finish. Coach White has also been the State Basketball Director for the KEYSTONE STATE GAMES since its inception in 1983.
                <br><br>
                    Jim Martin’s Scouting Report, The National Recruiter and The Pennsylvania Coaches’ Association ranked Keystone State #1 the best basketball camp in the East.
